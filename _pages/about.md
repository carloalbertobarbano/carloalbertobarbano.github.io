I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Turin, Italy. I am part of the [EIDOS group](https://eidos.di.unito.it/) at the Computer Science Department. My research focuses on deep learning for medical imaging, with interests on contrastive learning, neuroimaging, multimodality, debiasing and robustness. I received a **double Ph.D.** from Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and University of Turin in 2023, supervised by Pietro Gori (Télécom Paris) and Marco Grangetto (University of Turin).

**News:**
- *Jan. 2025:* I am currently a Visiting Researcher at [Inria MIND](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) with [Prof. Demian Wassermann](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/demian.wassermann/), to study the connection between functional connectivity and cognition using contrastive learning.
- *Dec. 2024:* I am happy to announce that I am now a member of [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/) 🎉! 
- *Mar. 2024:* I am member of the newborn [Asl To3 Radiomics Lab](https://www.aslto3.piemonte.it/azienda/progetti/progetti-aziendali/aslto3-radiomics-lab/?highlight=radiomics%20lab) in Rivoli, Italy. 

Ongoing Research
======

Here is a summary of main main ongoing activities. If you are **interested in collaborations** do not hesitate to contact me!

- **Foundation models / Neuroimaging** Learning generalizable representations from large cohorts of neuroimaging data with the aim of transferring knowledge to smaller clinical groups with different conditions (e.g. neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders). Relevant work: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07079) (AnatCL)
- **Multimodal Learning** Improving representations by leveraging cross-modal interaction (e.g. using text to learn novel visual concepts [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15611](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15611))
- **Debiasing and Collateral Learning** Learning unbiased models from biased data, both in a supervised or unsupervised fashion. Also providing human-interpretable descriptions of spurious correlations in the data ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09570](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09570))
