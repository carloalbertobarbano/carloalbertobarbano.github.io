I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Turin, Italy. I am part of the [EIDOS group](https://eidos.di.unito.it/) at the Computer Science Department. My research focuses on deep learning for medical imaging, with interests on contrastive learning, neuroimaging, multimodality, debiasing and robustness. I received a **double Ph.D.** from Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris) and University of Turin in 2023, supervised by Pietro Gori (Télécom Paris) and Marco Grangetto (University of Turin).
